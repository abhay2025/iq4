                    <b>Physics is the study of energy and matter in space and time. It deals with how the fundamental
                        constituents
                        of the universe interact.Physics starts emerging as one of the Science disciplines at this level
                        and
                        its
                        beauty lies in its numerical problems. In grade-10, students get to explore the fundamental laws
                        and
                        principles of Physics.
                        IQ Classes content aims to develop an in-depth understanding of these fundamentals and also make
                        sure
                        that students get enough material for practice and reinforcement.
